      <description>Occassionally I do something other than playing with EEG data. R can also handle a lot of spatial data - in other words, you can create nice maps. There’s the small matter of an election coming up next month which is probably our last chance of avoiding a disastrous Brexit.
I decided to try out some of R’s mapping functions and packages to see if I could come up with any useful graphics of the sort you usually see: maps showing turn-out, who won each constituency, things like that.</description>
